# tplot

A wrapper around matplotlib/numpy/scipy to make plotting csv tabular data easier. This project was initially just a `plot` python script in my `~/bin` folder. Since it kept growing, I decided to move it into its own separate package.

# Dependencies
```
matplotlib
numpy
scipy
SciencePlots
```

# Notes
- probably best to use numpy.loadtxt for reading files
- probably best to use numpy arrays for x,y data
